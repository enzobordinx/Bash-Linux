# Bash-Linux
This repository contains two Bash scripts. The first one is used to check if the Linux system meets the minimum requirements for installation. The second one automates the installation process. These scripts are designed to make it easier to install software on Linux systems. They are user-friendly and can save you time by automating the process.
